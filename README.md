You will use data on kinship structures to benchmark formal models of kinship. For this exercise, you will
use the DemoKin R package to implement formal models of kinship. You should choose one country and run
four different models according to the following specifications:
    One-sex model; approximate male kin using GKP factors
    â€“ time-invariant rates
